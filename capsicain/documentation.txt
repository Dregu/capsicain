-Modifier locking
  This is nice when you need to keep Ctrl-Shift pressed for 30 seconds.
  Press Esc + modifier, release modifier then Esc -> the mod stays pressed.
  Tap Esc to release all locks.
  For Alt you need to lock two times.

* Capsicain only processes keyboard events.
  Some Media Keys are not keyboard keys, but custom USB codes - just like a gamepad button is no keyboard key.
  If you need this, AutoHotKey is very good at dealing with all kinds of input devices.

* No characters.
  Capsicain deals with physical keys. Mapping to characters happens later in the Windows keyboard stack.
  This means, for example, that you cannot send the '!' character. You can only send [Shift]+[1].
  To send special characters, you can send ALT+NumPad combos. The altChar(123) function does that for you.
    Note that this is a Windows standard; Linux VMs do not understand these Alt combos.
    Note that in remote desktops you may have to increase the DelayForKeySequenceMS setting (in .ini or live with [ESC]+[,.])

* Some special keys are invisible.
  For example, the Fn key is handled internally on many keyboards. 
  If a key does not send a scancode over USB, the PC does not know about it.
  Another example, the 'Program' key on my Vortex keyboard does not produce a scancode.

* No mapping of pure modifier combos.
  For example, "Shift + Alt -> function(X)" is not possible.
  Exceptions: there is hardcoded handling for "both Shift" and "both Alt".

* No mapping of combos to modifiers.
  For example, "Alt + S -> Shift" is not possible.
