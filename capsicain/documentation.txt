* Capsicain only processes keyboard events.
  Media Keys are usually not keyboard keys, but custom USB codes - just like a gamepad button is no keyboard key.
  If you need this, AutoHotKey is very good at dealing with all kinds of input devices.

* Some special keys are invisible.
  For example, the Fn key is handled internally on many keyboards. If it does not send a scancode over USB, the PC does not know about it.
  Another example, the 'Program' key on my Vortex keyboard does not produce a scancode.

* No mapping of pure modifier combos.
  For example, "Shift + Alt -> function(X)" is not possible.
  Exceptions: there is hardcoded handling for "both Shift" and "both Alt".

* No mapping of combos to modifiers.
  For example, "Alt + S -> Shift" is not possible.

* No dead key combos
  Things like "ALT+U, then O -> ö" are not possible.
  
* No ALT+123 special chars in Linux VMs.
  The Windows way to create special chars is ALT+Numpad. For example, ALT+127 produces ⌂
  Linux does not understand this.

* No characters.
  Capsicain deals with physical keys. Mapping to characters happens later in the Windows keyboard stack.
  This means, for example, that you cannot send the '!' character. You can only send [Shift]+[1].
  To send special characters, you can send [Alt][1][2][3] combos. The altChar(123) function does that for you.
