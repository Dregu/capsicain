Ongoing stream of what I want to remember...

TODO
- user/pass, different keys for record playback
- test if static linking works for both ms*.dll
- timeout for tappings, deadkeys?
- record macros on key in (today) or on key out?
- nicer macro 'language'
- accented altChars should not ignore CapsLock ON
- rethink double tap breaking tapped state
- nicer syntax for input sequences (COMPOSE f y i [.T] > print("For your information")
- Documentation.....

v(old)
New ini GLOBALs
- delayOnStartupMS {number} (default 0. Useful if you need time to release keys when starting capsicain with a shortcut)
- startMinimized (default false. Capsicain starts minimized in the taskbar)
- startInTraybar (overrides startMinimized. Capsicain starts with a traybar icon instead of toolbar icon)

ESC key
Always lazy key with Capsicain (fires on release)
ESC + mod makes sticky mods
REWIRE ESC X   The key will not autorepeat

Modified handling for showing hiding window / taskbar / traybar
- any command with "info output" pops up the window
- can't move to tray on minimize (console is out of the Win event loop, it only sees incoming keys)

v63beta
git branch dev
massive changes following the switch from 8bit scancode to int vcode...
scancode is original
vcode is copy of original; possibly changed later
now free to define many virtual codes for specific functions like "turn LED on"
rewireIfTapped: Tab is first mapped to mod10, then 'iftapped' to Tab later
now assume that keysDownSent[] really knows the state of what Windows knows

v65beta
rework the tapping stuff
double tap no longer breaks tap
removed OPTION ShiftShiftToCapsLock (obsolete)
COMBO can deal with modifiers like COMBO LSHF [&.] > key (CAPSON)
new VKeys CAPSON, CAPSOFF
warn about unknown OPTIONs
add GLOBAL startAHK

v66beta
check for unknown GLOBALs
move constants to constants.h
move rewire conf to array

v67beta
- rewire // stands for "don't process this". NOP results in action.
- add 'time since last key' to debug output
- detect slow taps (those clear any tapped state)

v68beta
Configurable TapHold. Phew. Tapdance is complicated.

v69beta VS2019
- upgrade from VS2017 to VS2019
- retarget to latest vcruntime, msvcp (not sure if this still works on Win7)
-> may need to distribute new DLLs
- c++ 14 > c++ 17
- linter complains about bit operations on unsigned char (suck)
- cleaned up three new warnings about conversion types
- app icon is broken for debug (suck)
- breaking change: PAUSE:10 is now SLEEP 1000.  Now sleeps n milliseconds (was 1/10s before)
- take care of moddedKeys / when and when not to release physical modifiers
- now moddedKey() releases ALL physical modifiers

v70beta: fix flipAppleKeys
- some doc cleanup
note: flipYZ does not clash with the new rewire style since it's soft and late anyway

v71beta: dead keys
- startup console size 800x600
- create diacritics with 
  COMBO U [..T.] > deadkey(U)  //tapped-RCtrl, U activates deadkey SC_U
  COMBO DEADKEY-U  A [& ....] > altChar(0196)  //RSHF+A with dk-U active = 'Ä'

v72beta: OR
- [...| ...|] matches, if LShift OR RShift is down
- deadkey fixes
- added a ton of accented characters to the ini

v73beta: no more VS DLLs, fix
- static linking, ms* DLLs no longer required (Properties > codegen > RTlib=MT)
- fix: works now: empty mod string like COMBO A [] > key(B)
- some .ini and .ahk cleanup

v74beta
- ESC will stop macro and user/password recording
- fix REWIRE A NOP something
- debug off by default
- only start one instance (release and debug can run in parallel)
- remove GLOBAL delayOnStartup. Not needed, keys are auto released
- layer change resets all states
- fix: reset all options to default on layer change
- clean up: debug string
- unfinished: icon for disabled
- Reset with ESC-BSP
- clean up: reload, layer change, all ESC commands work everywhere
- remove sticky mods feature. Too hacky to get it right

v75beta: tray icon indicates active layer

v76beta: GLOBAL capsicainEnableDisableKey
If defined, this toggles the disabled state.
The key will also be forwarded to Windows.
Nice: ScrLock indicates state with LED and is otherwise a useless key.

v77beta: change name to capsicainOnOffKey
