New ini GLOBALs
- delayOnStartupMS {number} (default 0. Useful if you need time to release keys when starting capsicain with a shortcut)
- startMinimized (default false. Capsicain starts minimized in the taskbar)
- startInTraybar (overrides startMinimized. Capsicain starts with a traybar icon instead of toolbar icon)

ESC key
Always lazy key with Capsicain (fires on release)
ESC + mod makes sticky mods
REWIRE ESC X   The key will not autorepeat

Modified handling for showing hiding window / taskbar / traybar
- any command with "info output" pops up the window
- can't move to tray on minimize (console is out of the Win event loop, it only sees incoming keys)
